An internet tunneler for connecting Netlink and Xband games

See versions folder for standalone scripts - v2 has been tested as working online

If found to work well, this project will be merged with my fork of Dreampi

modemClass.py is borrowed from the Dreampi script to make sure I'll be able to integrate later. Thanks to Kazade et al for creating that [Dreampi](https://github.com/Kazade/dreampi)
