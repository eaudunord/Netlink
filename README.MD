An internet tunneler for connecting Netlink and Xband games

v4.0-beta is the latest tested as working online

If found to work well, this project will be merged with my fork of Dreampi

modemClass.py is borrowed from the Dreampi script to make sure I'll be able to integrate later. Thanks to Kazade et al for creating that
