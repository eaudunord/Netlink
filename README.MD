An internet tunneler for connecting Netlink and Xband games

v4.1-beta is the latest tested as working online

This can be integrated into Dreampi to add Netlink support. See the releases for the required updated scripts.

modemClass.py is borrowed and slightly modified from the Dreampi script. Thanks to Kazade et al for creating that invaluable tool.
